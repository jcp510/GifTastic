# GifTastic

This app is built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and [GIPHY API](https://developers.giphy.com/).

Open index.html in your browser.  Buttons with favorite topics will appear, click on a button and ten gifs with ratings will appear about that topic.

This app is in progress, I need to
* add functionality to initially render the gifs still.
* Animate the gifs when they are clicked, and if they are animated, render them still when they are clicked again.
* Add a form to give users the option to add more topic buttons.
